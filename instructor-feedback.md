#Collaboration
My peer feedback went well. I struggled a little with the time needed to analyze the repo, but I was still able to give constructive feedback. I suggested improvements to the README page and the Quarto document, focusing on structure and organization, and I also helped correct parts of the code that didnâ€™t follow conventional formatting.
