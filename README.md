## 1 - Project goal

Recreate figure 3 - Hurricane effects on stream chemistry, from the article *"Effects of hurricane disturbance on stream water concentrations and fluxes in eight tropical forest watersheds of the Luquillo Experimental Forest"*.

*Figure 3 - Concentrations in Bisley, Puerto Rico streams before and after Hurricane Hugo, 9-wk moving averages. (a) potassium, (b) nitrate-N, (c) magnesium, (d) calcium and (e) ammonium-N. The vertical lines mark the time of hurricane disturbance.*

## 2 -Methodology

The data was imported from the Environmental Data Initiative ([(McDowell and International Institute Of Tropical Forestry (IITF) 2024)](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?packageid=knb-lter-luq.20.492306){.uri} and arranged for the creation of the figure 3 of the article. A 9-week moving average was calculated for the concentration of the following nutrients: (a) potassium, (b) nitrate-N, (c) magnesium, (d) calcium, and (e) ammonia-N. The graph was created with ggplot2, and the results were compared with the original figure.
