## 1 - Project goal

Recreate figure 3 - Hurricane effects on stream chemistry, from the article *"Effects of hurricane disturbance on stream water concentrations and fluxes in eight tropical forest watersheds of the Luquillo Experimental Forest"*.

## Methodology

The data imported from the Environmental Data Initiative [(McDowell and International Institute Of Tropical Forestry (IITF) 2024)](<https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?packageid=knb-lter-luq.20.492306> were arranged for the creation of the figure. A 9-week moving average was calculated for the concentration of the following nutrients: (a) potassium, (b) nitrate-N, (c) magnesium, (d) calcium, and (e) ammonia-N. The graphs were created with ggplot2, and the results were compared with the original figure.
